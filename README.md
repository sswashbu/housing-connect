# Housing Connect

The goal of housing connect is to create a medium for property owners and potential tenants.
We aim to have a simple, easy to use interface. If we get to it maybe have a chat system.
property owner should be able to post a listing of their properties with a picture and description.
Potential tenants should be able to search and filter the list of the properties.

These should link to the google drive stuff for this project, assuming nothing bad happens to the links.
